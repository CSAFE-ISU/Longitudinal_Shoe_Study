{\bf Re: Submission to Forensic Science International}\\\vspace{2em}

Dear Professor Margot, \vspace{1em}

Please find attached a manuscript, ``Longitudinal Study of Athletic Shoe Wear" intended for submission to FSI.
The manuscript describes an extensive, longitudinal study of athletic shoe wear, with data recorded in a number of different modalities of interest to forensic practitioners. Components of this dataset have been available online for several months and have already been downloaded 3700 times during that interval; as a result, we would like to make the forensics community aware of this resource and have prioritized community awareness over withholding the data until we are ready to publish the full slate of methods papers we are developing using this data. As a result, this paper is short and focuses primarily on the description of the experiment and showcasing the available types of data.
\vspace{1em}

I hope that you find the manuscript acceptable for publication in FSI. I have submitted this manuscript as a Research Article, but we recognize that it has elements of both Rapid Communications (in that we would like to make the community aware of the data as soon as possible) and Technical Notes (as it is a relatively short, technical description of the data), we would be more than happy to publish the article under either article type. We are aware that the international forensics community is much more likely to utilize footwear evidence than forensic practitioners in the United States, thus, FSI is our preferred publication because of its international audience, broad readership, and reputation for quality. \vspace{1em}

If there is any additional information I can provide, please feel free to contact me directly. \vspace{1em}

Sincerely,\\
