Longitudinal Shoe Study
================

## Study Description

The study consists of 160 pairs of shoes:
- Two models (Nike Winflo 4 or Adidas Seeley)
- Four possible sizes for each model

Each pair of shoes was worn for at least 10,000 steps per week over a 6-month period, with multiple measurements of the shoe soles taken initially and during three check-in periods spaced at approximately 5 week intervals. 

Measurements were taken using the following equipment:

- TekScan Mat Scanner (initial visit only)
- Everspry EverOS 2D Digital Scanner
- EinScan+ Pro 3D Scanner
- Digital Camera (photograph of the sole)
- Powder and Adhesive Film
- Powder and Paper
- Powder and Vinyl flooring

Images are named with respect to the following convention:
{ID#}_{Date}_{Method}_{Image#}_{Rep#}_{ID of technician(s)}

where:
- ID# is a 6 digit number followed by {RL} indicating the shoe
    - The first three digits are the shoe ID
    - The second three digits are a checksum
    - R = right shoe, L = left shoe
- Date, in yyyymmdd format, indicating the date the data was collected (not the date the shoes were turned in for data collection)
- Method_Image_Replicate

### Collection Method Documentation

#### Initial Longitudinal Study

The [baseline collection
procedures](Collection_Procedures/Documentation/Methods-Techniques-Shoe.pdf)
were used in the collection of initial data about the unworn shoes and
the study participants as well as during the study. The baseline
procedure documents the collection procedures; a separate document
describes [changes made to these procedures during the
study](Collection_Procedures/Documentation/Procedure.pdf) to improve
image quality and reduce equipment malfunctions.

In addition, single-procedure files are provided for each collection
method:

#### Realistic Prints Expansion

At the conclusion of the longitudinal study, we decided to create prints
similar to those which may be found at a crime scene with some of the
worn shoes.
