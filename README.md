## Study Description

A longitudinal study of 160 shoes. Shoes were Nike Winflo 4 or Adidas
Seeley, and were worn for approximately 6 months, with data collected
initially and during 4 check-in periods.

### Collection Method Documentation

#### Initial Longitudinal Study

The [baseline collection
procedures](Collection_Procedures/Documentation/Methods-Techniques-Shoe.pdf)
were used in the collection of initial data about the unworn shoes and
the study participants as well as during the study. The baseline
procedure documents the collection procedures; a separate document
describes [changes made to these procedures during the
study](Collection_Procedures/Documentation/Procedure.pdf) to improve
image quality and reduce equipment malfunctions.

In addition, single-procedure files are provided for each collection
method:

worn shoes.
