## Study Description

The study consists of 160 pairs of shoes:
- Two models (Nike Winflo 4 or Adidas Seeley)
- Four possible sizes for each model

Each pair of shoes was worn for at least 10,000 steps per week over a 6-month period, with multiple measurements of the shoe soles taken initially and during three check-in periods spaced at approximately 5 week intervals.

Measurements were taken using the following equipment: EinScan Pro+ 3D Scanner

## Image-Specific Metadata

Images are named with respect to the following convention:
`{ID#}_{Date}_{Method}_{Image#}_{Rep#}_{ID of technician(s)}` where:

- ID# is a 6 digit number followed by {RL} indicating the shoe
- The first three digits are the shoe ID
- The second three digits are a checksum
- R = right shoe, L = left shoe
- Date, in yyyymmdd format, indicating the date the data was collected (not the date the shoes were turned in for data collection)
- Method_Image_Replicate: these fields are hierarchically determined - the meaning of the values for image and replicate depend on the method.
    - Method: 3D Scan = 3
    - Image: 
        - 1: Handheld scan
        - 2: Turntable scan
    - Replicate: 2-3 replicates per shoe/image
- ID of technician(s): Some methods require that an individual wear the shoe, another individual collect the data; in those cases names are separated by underscores.

The images are accompanied by 3 CSV files describing the shoes, visit (information collected from surveys along with the shoes), and individual images.

The codebooks contain descriptions of the variables in each of the CSV files as well as a more extensive description of the Method_Image_Replicate coding described above.
